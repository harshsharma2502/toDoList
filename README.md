A simple and intuitive Todo List application built with React. This app allows users to add, edit, mark as done, and delete tasks. Tasks are managed in the browser's memory and are not persistent across sessions or browser refreshes.

✨ Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.

Mark as Done: Toggle tasks between active and completed states.

Edit Tasks: Modify existing task descriptions directly from the list.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Custom Confirmation: Utilizes a custom modal for delete confirmations instead of native browser prompts.

🚀 Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

UUID: For generating unique IDs for tasks.

Inline CSS: For styling the application components.
